                The spacing effect describes the robust finding that long-term learning
                 is promoted when learning events are spaced out in time, rather than 
                 presented in immediate succession. Studies of the spacing effect have 
                 focused on memory processes rather than for other types of learning, 
                 such as the acquisition and generalization of new concepts. In this 
                 study, early elementary school children (5â€“7 year-olds; N = 36) were 
                 presented with science lessons on one of three schedules: massed, 
                 clumped, and spaced. The results revealed that spacing lessons out in 
                 time resulted in higher generalization performance for both simple and complex 
                 concepts. Spaced learning schedules promote several types of learning, 
                 strengthening the implications of the spacing effect for educational 
                 practices and curriculum.
